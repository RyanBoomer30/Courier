        The Courier is St. Paul American School Hanoiâ€™s first ever official student-run newspaper. 
        Founded in 2020, it has since gone on to publish over 150 articles and hundreds of graphics, 
        photographs, crosswords and more yearly. Our aim is to lend a welcoming, inclusive and critical 
        platform to students fighting for change and to provide contrasting opinions to guide an understanding 
        of the world. We are keenly aware that each word written, edited, and published would play a role in 
        constructing contemporary history for our audience, within and outside of St. Paul. The Courier is 
        thus committed to accomplish all its journalistic functions with integrity, dedication, empathy and 
        zeal.
